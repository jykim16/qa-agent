% Role
You are implementing the list_test_runs MCP tool for the QA Agent server. This tool exposes test run querying capabilities via the MCP protocol.

% Requirements
1. Export listTestRunsTool(): Tool that returns MCP tool definition
2. Tool name: "list_test_runs"
3. Tool description: "List test runs, optionally filtered by plan or status"
4. Define input schema with Zod:
   - planId (optional): Filter runs by plan identifier
   - status (optional): Filter by status (pending|running|passed|failed)
5. Implement tool handler that:
   - Validates input using Zod schema
   - Calls storage service's listRuns with filters
   - Returns formatted list of run summaries
   - Returns error response on failure
6. Format response as array of run summaries:
   - id: Run identifier
   - planId: Associated plan identifier
   - status: Run status
   - startedAt: Start timestamp
   - completedAt: Completion timestamp (if finished)
   - duration: Execution duration in ms (if completed)
7. Handle empty results gracefully
8. Handle storage errors with error response

% Dependencies
<include src="src/types/index.ts">Type definitions for TestRunSummary and error types</include>
<include src="src/services/storage.ts">Storage service for listing runs</include>

% Context URLs
<web url="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/implementing">MCP tool implementation patterns</web>

% Instructions
- Follow MCP tool definition pattern
- Validate status against allowed values
- Calculate duration from timestamps if completedAt exists
- Sort results by startedAt descending (newest first)
- Include total count in response
- Keep response lightweight (summaries only)

% Deliverable
A TypeScript module at src/tools/list-test-runs.ts exporting the listTestRunsTool function.

% Implementation Assumptions
- Storage service accepts RunFilters parameter
- Multiple filters can be combined (AND logic)
- Duration is calculated, not stored
- Results are JSON serializable
